              <p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">How do we do it?</h3>
              <p>
                After building 300+ projects, we've learned a lot. We've learned to ask the right questions. We've learned to say no to projects that don't match our expertise. We've learned to be transparent and share everything with our clients. We've learned that it's our jobs to understand your business, so we can bring new ideas to the table. We treat our clients the way we would like to be treated if we were on your shoes. And every year, we build an internal project just to make sure that we're treating you with the best standards.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">Should you work with us?</h3>
              <p>
                Maybe not. We're picky with who we work with. We only want to work with great teams, nice people, and on project where we know we can make an impact. We guarantee your ROI, so we don't take everything that comes along. If you're looking for a tech partner, reach out.

                As a business owner, I always hated how software development firms had obscure pricing, forced you on multi-year long contracts, and never saw projects come to life.
